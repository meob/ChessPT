            <p>Welcome to <strong>Chess Personal Trainer</strong>! 
<strong>ChessPT</strong> turns opening theory into muscle memory. By automating the first moves, you gain a decisive advantage on 
the clock and on the board, ideal for dominating in fast online games.</p>
            
            <h2>Main Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Play as White / Play as Black:</strong> Use the button at the top of the left panel to switch between training modes. When you play as Black, the board will be oriented from your perspective and the computer will make White's moves.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Selection:</strong> Use the dropdown menu to choose an opening you want to practice. The list of openings is different depending on whether you are playing as White or Black.</li>
                <li><strong>Load PGN...:</strong> Click this button to load your own PGN file from your computer for a temporary training session.</li>
                <li><strong>Start Training:</strong> Click the 'Start Training' button to load the selected opening.</li>
                <li><strong>Restart Game:</strong> Click the 'Restart Game' button to restart the current opening from the beginning.</li>
                <li><strong>Playing Moves:</strong> You can move pieces by dragging and dropping (on PC) or by clicking the piece and then the destination square (on all devices).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Training Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for each opening is to complete it <strong>5 times without any errors</strong>. This number is the default, but can be customized within each PGN file by adding a <code>[TargetCompletions "X"]</code> tag. 
                When you achieve this, a confirmation message will appear, and your result (date, opening name, and total time) will be saved locally.
<br>
                You can view all your saved achievements by clicking the "Achievements" link on the main page. On the achievements page, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sort Results:</strong> Click on the table headers (Date, Opening, Total Time) to sort your achievements.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete an Entry:</strong> Click the "Delete" button on any row to remove that specific achievement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chess Personal Trainer</h2>
            <p>
In fast online games like blitz and bullet, time is a resource as important as the pieces. Wasting precious seconds 
  to recall the correct opening sequence puts you at an immediate disadvantage. The goal of this exercise is not just 
  to learn theory, but to turn it into instinct. Through repeated practice and immediate correction, your brain stops 
  'calculating' the initial moves and starts 'recognizing' them as a single pattern. This automation process allows you
   to execute the opening quickly and flawlessly, saving mental energy and time on the clock for the more complex and 
  decisive phases of the game: the middlegame and the endgame.
